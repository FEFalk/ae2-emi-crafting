# AE2 EMI Crafting Integration

It does what it says in the tin and nothing more.

Items inside an AppEng terminal are shown on EMI, and it can use them for crafting.

All EMI functionality you'd expect from a vanilla crafting table also should work, including but not limited to:

- Shift-Clicking recipes
- Viewing which items are available on the recipe tree
- Bringing items from *all available inventories*, **including** your hotbar
- Support for tags, prioritizing the item you have the most of on the AE2 system
 

This mod has integrations for both AE2 and AE2WTLib.
